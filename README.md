# Movie-Trailer-Website
Movie Trailer Website

ABOUT
This project will build a Movie Trailer Website where you can see some movies and watch the trailers by clicking on the movies. 

This Movie Trailer Website Project consists of 3 Python version 2.7.12 files that store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. 

The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent movies and groups all the instances together in a list.

The file fresh_tomatoes.py contains the open_movies_page() function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase your favorite movies.

-media.py
-entertainment_center.py
